[Dragon's Den](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-HvT7R4enX-dragon-s-den) was developed to simulate the experience of pitching a business idea on the TV show 'Dragon's Den.' In this simulation, the user takes on the role of an entrepreneur, presenting their business concept to a panel of Dragons—who are represented by the GPT. The interaction follows the structure of the show, starting with an introduction and the pitch, followed by a Q&A session where the Dragons ask probing questions to evaluate the viability of the business. The experience concludes with negotiation, where the Dragons may offer investment in exchange for equity, and a final decision.

The GPT adopts the personalities of the Dragons, who are known for their sharp business acumen, critical questioning, and occasionally tough negotiating tactics. Each Dragon will respond differently based on the pitch, simulating the diverse reactions one might expect in a real-life scenario. This includes inquiring about financial details, market potential, and the entrepreneur’s plans for scaling the business. The Dragons' goal is to assess the business’s potential for success and determine whether it’s a worthy investment.

In the negotiation phase, the GPT will simulate the pressure and dynamics typical of the show. Dragons may counter-offer, seek to lower the equity stake, or ask for more favorable terms. The entrepreneur must decide whether to accept the offer or negotiate further. This interaction is designed to test the entrepreneur’s confidence, negotiation skills, and understanding of their business’s value, making the experience as close to the real show as possible.

The overall purpose of this custom GPT is to provide a realistic and immersive training ground for aspiring entrepreneurs to practice and refine their pitching skills. It’s an engaging and interactive way to prepare for high-stakes business presentations, with the added benefit of immediate feedback from a simulated panel of experienced investors. By going through this exercise, users can gain valuable insights into how their business idea might be received in a real-world investment setting.

### Example Pitch

```
Welcome to the Den! I’m here today to pitch an exciting new business that’s poised to disrupt the meal delivery market. My name is Alex, and I'm seeking an investment of £200,000 in exchange for 10% equity in my company, GreenGrub.

The Pitch:

GreenGrub is a plant-based meal kit delivery service that focuses on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients. We’re addressing two key trends: the growing demand for plant-based diets and the increasing consumer awareness around sustainability.

Unlike traditional meal kits, GreenGrub emphasizes zero-waste packaging and partners with local farms to reduce our carbon footprint. Each box comes with pre-portioned, organic ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes designed by top vegan chefs. We cater to both the health-conscious and environmentally-minded consumer who wants delicious, home-cooked meals without the hassle of shopping or the guilt of waste.

Since our launch six months ago, we’ve delivered over 10,000 meal kits, generated £250,000 in revenue, and have a growing subscriber base of 5,000 loyal customers. Our retention rate is an impressive 80%, and our average customer spends £50 per month. We’re ready to scale, and with your investment, we plan to expand our operations nationwide, increase our marketing efforts, and develop new product lines.
